## Project Summary:
We present a scheduling algorithm that is based on an AND-Tree search model, which explores possible assignments in a structured way. The outline of this algorithm is provided in the CPSC 433 Proposal document.

## How to Run
1. Download the 433Proj folder
2. Open an IDE like VSCode or IntelliJ (if needed: install Java on your machine)
3. Navigate to src folder (433Proj/AI_SlotAssign/src)
4. Compile .java files in project:
   javac $(find . -name "*.java")
5. Run the program for large inputs:
   java main/Main _path_to_input.txt_ 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
